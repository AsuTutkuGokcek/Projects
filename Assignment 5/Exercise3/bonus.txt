To prevent the code from having buffer overflow like in line 13, 
we have to adjust the input size to be scanned to exact number in username[]. Buffer overflow may
also happen when there's no '&' or sometimes fflush may be needed. In scanf buffer overflow usually
happens when scanned input does not exactly fit the variable it will be assigned to.
