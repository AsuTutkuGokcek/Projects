Explanation of Assignment4 by Asu Tutku Gökçek

I did every phase using gdb and everytime before restarting gdb I always put at least a couple breakpoints so they kept me safe from explode_bomb.
In phase 1, I used the comment to find out the input necessary.
In phase 2, I understood from assembly the type of input and then by trials I understood there was a pattern with the numbers so I was able to find the necessary values.
In phase 3, I guessed the first input myself, it took longer to find the second one. By constantly doing info reg I found the second value. 
In phase 4, the procedure was hard because I thought the mistake was in input 2 when it was is input 1. After a while instead of changing input 2 I started trying different input 1s, as it had to be between some intervals I found it after a few trials.
In phase 5, I tried 6 letters from the alphabet starting from the first letter and going on till the end trying the next 6 letters every time, I noted down the numbers constantly checking info reg and found the right characters.
In phase 6, after long examination of the assembly code I realised that it was sorting the nodes and found the right order.
